Hey ran into you on ()  
Just wanna say that you are so beautiful  
  
So guys flirting with you a lot. A ouple girls can't play ball a few.  
That's why I only code in VIM coders.  
You ar in a field with a mostly sociallly awkward guys that are always goind to be bad at people  
I find many of them don't shower enough if you haven't had to side  
I would say conersvatives in public get it worse, but I'm not here to rank the hurt and then give the most hurt the most credibility.  
Some people are shit heads, and you intentaionl enage a lot of people.  
None of that should ahve hurt you.  
If it did, toughen your mind.  
  
I know it's totally random but I hate your adorable face

Hello Ali,  
Your name alid is a name of a male not for female  
It is arabic word  
  
I am afraid to this ali. But you are not ready for tweeter. You want the fame and attentino that comes with it but you are not ready for the jerks that are on it. It's par of the deal girl! lauughing emoji  
  
  
Bust 9 times out of 10 if a woman wrote the post or made said video itll get 10x more shares and likes as aposed to if a man did it I have no arg in this figght I just want to speak the truth of this blasphemy society and wish to change it so we AL get the same respect we need  
  
Just me when I usually watch video content. I prefer male just because woman usual has really high pitch voic. But when it comes to written articles. I pprefer woman. Their writing feels much easier to understand.  
  
Just like a morning you wake up nex to me  
  
Don't mind ... but your front two teeths are distracting..... you uu look to cute  
  
You neeed to update your photo on instagram with the one from twitter. They're both lovely but your Twitter one iis.... ahs less badic  
  
Nobody wnats you to speak anywhere so no problems here asshole emoji  
  
I though race didn't exist and we were supposed to be colorblind and to respect people for the content of their characters...
