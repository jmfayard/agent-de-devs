The Net interprets _censorship_ as damage and _routes around it.

I initially tried in good faith to publish this content on Microsoft LinkedIn, even if I thought at that time it was a bad website to do job hunting or searching for a job, but in good faith. 

And then they censored me for an ugly reason. 

Well you know what ? 
Fine, I will put all my content on Open Source on Microsoft GitHub.

## Help needed

This repository is in an early stage of chaos.

I have written lots of contents of over the year, talked with many people, in different languages and I need help to build my ultimate goal of having an encyclopedia of having a good carreer in tech in multiple language. 

Any of you know how to do open source by any chance ?

## Where to find my existing content ?

All over the place, some public, some not, some stories told, some written, some in private communities.

But those are probably the best starting point
