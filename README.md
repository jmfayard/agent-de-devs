# We Shall Improve Hiring Somewhat

Hello, I'm Jean-Michel Fayard aka agent double and I think that we shall improve tech hiring and job hunting somewhat.

## Why ?

Lots of questions have been a ghost in my head for a very long time related to developer careers. 

- Why do dev with skills and companies who needs those skills have such a hard time finding each other ?
- Why do we hear from all parts that everyone should code, while at the same time finding the first developer job is so difficult ?
- Why do developers dread job hunting if it's true that our skills are in high demand ?
- Why is imposter syndrome poisoning so many of us ?
- Why do devs talks about hiring processes at HypeStartups like if it was the labours of Hercules ?
- Why did Google, the dream company of my youth, thought for so long that making the ability to answer brain teasers an hiring criteria was a good idea ?
- Why do devs accept to spend their weekends on taking home challenges ?
- Why are salary negociations the way they are ?
- Why ghosting ?
- Why do some people lash out in anger every time we suggest that a job interview at a given company went poorly ?
- Why are we told to use LinkedIn which is obviously bad at the job at the job it's supposed to do ?
- Why do company focus on finding good candidates and not good developers ?

And more importantly. 

How can we FIX IT ?

## What  ?

I have decided to do something about it, and after talking with many many people over the year, I have decided to share what I have learned so far in public.


In order to help better practices spread, I have decided to Open Source and centralise all my content here.

## Caveat

The ["I am very intelligent" people](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/we-should-improve-society-somewhat)" will point out I'm a big hypocrite because I also plan to make money from it. And you know what ? They are right. And I don't care anymore about them, they are part of the problem and I want to be part of the solution.
