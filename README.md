# Tech Hiring is Broken, and We Shall Improve It Somewhat.

Hello, I'm Jean-Michel Fayard aka agent double and I think that we shall improve tech hiring and job hunting somewhat.

## Why ?

For a very long time, I have observed that there are lots of things that are suboptimal in the way tech companies hire and vice versa.

Pretty much agree that there lots of bad practices.
I have talked with many people and discovered that better practices exist.
Now, the issue is that they typically requires time and efforts and make sense only in a given context.
At the same time, bad practices spread like a virus. Asking brain teaser requires no effort whatsoever, and it helps the interviewer feel smart.

Therefore bad practices are naturally more viral than good practices, and that's an issue.

I think we should also do something about it, because we have a skin in the game : 

It's our job, our careers, even our lives.

## What  ?

I have decided to do something about it, and after talking with many many people over the year, I have decided to share what I have learned so far in public.


In order to help better practices spread, I have decided to Open Source and centralise all my content here.

## Caveat

The ["I am very intelligent" people](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/we-should-improve-society-somewhat)" will point out I'm a big hypocrite because I also plan to make money from it. And you know what ? They are right. And I don't care anymore about them, they are part of the problem and I want to be part of the solution.
