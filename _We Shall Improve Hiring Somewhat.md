At no point in time was I ready to live through the many sharps ups and especially downs of this 12-years long odyssea of mine.

## Why ?

Lots of questions have been a ghost in my head for a very long time related to developer careers. 

- Why do dev with skills and companies who needs those skills have such a hard time finding each other ?
- Why does job hunting feels like we are students applying for college and not professionals finding out whether it makes sense to work together ?
- Why do we hear from all parts that everyone should code, while at the same time finding the first developer job is so difficult ?
- Why do developers dread job hunting if it's true that our skills are in high demand ?
- Why is imposter syndrome poisoning so many of us ?
- Why do devs talks about hiring processes at HypeStartups like if it was the labours of Hercules ?
- Why did Google, the dream company of my youth, thought for so long that making the ability to answer brain teasers an hiring criteria was a good idea ?
- Why do devs accept to spend their weekends on taking home challenges ?
- Why are salary negociations the way they are ?
- Why ghosting ?
- Why do some people lash out in anger every time we suggest that a job interview at a given company went poorly ?
- Why are we told to use LinkedIn which is obviously bad at the job at the job it's supposed to do ?
- Why do company focus on finding good candidates and not good developers ?

And more importantly. 

How can we FIX IT ?

## How it all started

I always was good at school, with a reputation of being lazy, because it worked well enough for me. I went to a very good engineering school in France. Then in 2003 I went in a very good university in Germany. Then in 2007 I went back home to start my career.

Software developer is this well paid job that everyone agreed now and then has a bright future. 

On the surface, everything seemed to work well on me.

Granted, I was also a socially awkward introverted dude.

But more importantly, deep inside, I have struggled all my life with self doubt.

## Self doubt

I have meant to tell this story since 12 years, I'm not ready, but I just can't procrastinate any more. 

{% embed https://dev.to/codenewbieteam/how-do-you-deal-with-self-doubt-4nek %}

For my very first job in France, I had no idea what I was doing. I ended up accepting the first job offer I got, at TerribleConsultingCompany. 
At that time, and even today, they were the ones hiring juniors en masse.

TerribleConsultingCompany found me quickly a QA job with nice people, I got paid for that. 
That job was also terribly boring for me. 
I was bored out.

The most terrible mistake I made in my life was to stay there far too long.
When I tried to get my act together, and to switch back to software engineering, things went real bad. 
The bore out turned to a full scale mental break down. 

Once. Twice. And then again and again.

When I finally get out of it, I had to suffer in a state of huge vulnerability of stupidly bad hiring practices. I got rejected again and again. I was hurt. I thought I could never recover. 

I gave up my career as a developer. If that was the ends of it, thanks, but no thanks.

## Depression, aka the Sound of Silence

It's something difficult to say publicly, but it's necessary : I have done many depressions since then.

{% embed https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood) %}

There are words that you can use to describe rationally what depression **is**.

The issue here is that depression is a deeply emotional experience.

And until you can make that emotional connection, you don't understand what happens to you, you can't explain depression to yourself. 
You can't explain depression to others, who don't understand you. 
And those others are afraid because it sure looks like a terrible thing.
And because they don't know what to do, and they fear to make things worse.

## Depression, the secret we all share

{% embed https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBYUn-FEscc %}

Transcript: https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_solomon_depression_the_secret_we_share/transcript

The other thing you need to know is that depression - aka burn out - is really really commmon. 

At the same time, many people suffering from it feel like that they are alone in the world. And the world around them can't help because it's so hard to connect and understand what happens.

And exactly that is a recipe for disaster.

Think about all the harmful horseshit society used to believe about Lesbians, Gay, Bi and Trans. How those people had to live undercover, alone, shamed by the society, and shamed from the inside.

This had terrible effects in the 1980s and 1990s when the AIDS epidemics started.

Now, there are important differences. Most importantly, unlike gayness, depression is a sickness that people want to get rid of. 

But the the harmful myths, the social stigma, the fear, the isolation, the unnecessary suffering, it's the very same story, really. 

We have something very common, well researched by science, but very poorly understood by its victims, future victims, the people who love them and their colleagues.

Because of this mess, Art is currently the only way I know to communicate what Depression really is.

## The Art of Depression

Do you know how to use Google Images ?

Try **depression art** : https://www.google.com/search?q=depression+art

![](https://share.cleanshot.com/48KXdGdB+)

That's very telling and very visual.

"**You Should Just Do Sport**" won't solve an issue of this magnitude as you can see. Jeez, great advice, I wonder why I didn't have the idea yet /sarcasm. "*You should try surfing" is good advice in general, but not when a tsunami is coming at them.

As a founding father of american democracy once said :

[I believe we ought to do all we can and seek to lift ourselves by our own boostraps. But it's a cruel jest to say to a bootless man that he ought to lift himself by his own bootstraps.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xD8vWQJEok)


## Rachmaninov fights against despair

For my part, music has always been the language of my soul and of my emotions. 

Rachmaninov too had a terrible mental breakdown. In the abyss of despair, his doctor remembered him that he was more than  a pathetic suffering loser. Beyond the hurt, he was also genius music composer. His doctor had the intuition that Rachmaninov could transform his pain into music to understand it, to create meaning out of it. When Rachmaninov got better, he wrote his piano concerto nÂ°2 that is known for his virtuosity and beauty among people who like classical music. 

But for me, oh boy, Rachmaninov's concerto is so much more than that. It is the most poignant, emotionally powerful, accurate description of what happens after a mental breakdown when hope comes back. Rachmaninov tells a story about mental health. Krystian Zimerman relates that story to me, probably mixing it with his own darkness. I heard it and immediately got it. Later I passed the tip to other friends that were in suffering. And now it's your turn, if you too needs to try someday my secret weapon against despair.

## Writing as self therapy

Contrary to an harmful sexist myth, therapy is not for the weaks.
Therapy is for people who are not interested in having a bad life for the sake of not appearing weak.

Therapy was instrumental for me in getting better. 
But on top of that, writing played a huge role for me. 

And it all started on DEV.to, 6 years ago. 

For my first article, I had no idea what I was doing here, or what DEV was. I had some mediocre articles on Medium.com. One article was somewhat less bad than the others, and I copy pasted it here. 

{% embed https://dev.to/jmfayard/pull-requests-a-simpleworkflow-dha %}

So remember, that yes, you should always write that first post. 

{% embed https://dev.to/jmfayard/yes-you-should-write-that-firstpost-481 %}

And then, I wrote more and more.

{% embed https://dev.to/jmfayard/20-lessons-i-ve-learned-writing-on-dev-for-4-years-4nk3 %}

I wrote on geeky topics for a long time. 

At some point people found what I had to say interesting.

This one was important to me, because I had a love-hate relationship with Android and needed to end it. 

{% embed  https://dev.to/jmfayard/android-s-billion-dollar-mistake-327b %}

But then my writing took a completely different direction. I got back to the roots of what went wrong at the start of my career.

This started when I wrote that developers, men and even more women, get treated unfairly during salary negociations. 

{% embed https://dev.to/jmfayard/what-is-your-current-salary-is-a-red-flag-that-you-don-t-want-to-work-here-3aji %}

I was absolutely terrified when I posted this article, the first of a long list about developer careers that is not going to end soon. I as way outside of my comfort zone. Both on the subject matter and whether I could write on this on DEV. I was overwhelmed with joy when I saw the response. 

Apart from a few very intelligent people lashing out in anger, keep that in mind for later.

## Hiring Is Broken and isn't Worth Fixing

I became obsessed with hiring in tech, and developer careers in general. 

Because at that point I understood intuitively that the secret to overcome my trauma was to fight back against what was the cause of that trauma. I decided that the fight of my life would be against bad hiring practices.

{% embed https://dev.to/jmfayard/what-are-your-biggest-frustrations-in-the-hiring-process-5fic %}

Erik Dietrich struck a chord with me here

https://daedtech.com/hiring-is-broken/

The CV is a terrible medium, so why is it still the basis of everything ?

{% embed https://daedtech.com/my-candidate-description/ %}

Facts over feelings : Google is bad at hiring.

{% embed https://daedtech.com/deploying-guerrilla-tactics-combat-stupid-tech-interviews/ %}

This topic became my mantra. 
But there was a big obstacle.

## ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Meanwhile in Berlin

The only reason I got back to programming is that  I moved to Berlin at the end 2014.
I needed to leave all that bad experiences behind me.
Since that was a huge challenge in itself, I came back to my original job. 

That was the best decision of my life. I have so much good memories there. 
Oh well depression is a bitch, and I got depressed 3 times more and that was hell.
But in between I had finally happy times.

And that redemption was correlated with meeting people who were hiring in a way that I had not experienced before. 

A recruiter who told me for the first time in my life
*I have a number of clients, so I prefer to understand you first. What would you liked to do ideally ?*

A CEO who understood that he needed to hire good developers and not good candidates.

A colleague who understood that it was more rational to evaluate developers by having a look at what they put on GitHub.

Another recruiter who told me that her favorite interview question was 

*I have your CV, I've read it, and don't worry, we will talk about if*.
*But first I want to ask you something* : 
*Is there something that is NOT in your CV, but that you would like to share with me, because that shaped who you are as a person today ?*

A CTO that hired me over a phone call and a lunch at my favorite japanese restaurant.

Another CTO later who hired me via a tweet followed by a cafÃ© discussion that went so well that we both knew at then end of it that the match was there already. 

It sounded like we could have simpler things. It worked better. Things started to make sense again. 

But what hits me the hardest was this one time when I wanted to do freelancing and hard to decide for the first time what my hourly rate was going to be. 

- Hey, I have an opportunity to work at $FamousGermanCompany but they want to hire me as a freelancer and I have no idea what my hourly rate. 
- Tell me
- Do you think $THIS is too much ?
- It's not enough, $famousGermanCompany has the money, you should ask $SignificantlyMore
- Wait, I can do that ?

And then this person, who had worked with me, whom I respected deeply, answered as if it was a self-evident truth
- Of course, you are a good engineer.

I almost cried.

It was not about the money. Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of having more money like everyone else. But it was more than that.

I was 37 and I was finally done with all that self doubt.

## Developer careers

Since I was accused of being lazy, I accepted that from all my hearth. 

{% embed https://dev.to/jmfayard/laziness-impatience-and-hubris-1ea9 %}

In general, I wanted people to have a better career much faster than I had. Procrastination is something I struggled with for a very long time. So I shared my thoughts about that as well.

{% embed https://dev.to/jmfayard/you-can-not-and-should-not-stop-procrasting-2ooh %}

Other dumb things I struggled with is that I had that toxic idea that there was "smart" and "dumb" questions, and that you somehow needed to be super qualified and prove your worth before you were allowed to ask a question. Jesus, no, the only dumb way to ask a question is to ask it only to the wrong person, or to not ask it at all. Ask, just ask.

{% embed https://dev.to/jmfayard/asking-questions-is-always-smart-19mj %}


## Sexism is real

With all that back story in mind, you understand tat when I wrote that article about imposter syndrome, I was writing is first and foremost for younger me.

{% embed https://dev.to/jmfayard/the-real-imposter-is-the-inner-judge-3e01 %}

But I was also writing this article remembering about Ali Splittel who wrote this, years earlier.

{% embed https://dev.to/aspittel/managing-imposter-syndrome-4a30 %}

There are many good writers here, but Ali Splittel in particular impressed me when I started writing. She wrote on a range of careers-related topics, gave solid advice, wrote so well. 

What an absolute pearl of a pedagogue. 

Then I wonder how did she learn all those things about imposter syndrome. Personal experience like me. Oh no. This shit again.

But while my painfully slow career start was a clear responsible for my self doubt, how could *she* possibly have imposter syndrome, given how obviously talented she was ?

In 2019 and 2020, DEV.to had the great idea to encourage women who code to talk about their personal stories. You can still find all kind of inspirational stories right here :

{% tag shecoded %}

But here things started also to be ugly. 

I have my theory that some toxic tech bros were a big part of Ali's imposter syndrome. See here in 2019.

{% embed https://dev.to/aspittel/nevertheless-ali-coded-4id0 %}

In case you wonder, it didn't stop in 2020.

{% embed https://dev.to/aspittel/nevertheless-ali-coded-e2h %}

Remember when I told you earlier that a tiny but toxic minority was upset ? 

I could feel they were people who self-identify as hard working, intelligent people devoid of emotions. And they were lashing out in anger that we dared to have a rational discussion about how we shall improve things somewhat.

It's all connected and it's very stupid. Text-book sexist education. Emotions, except anger, are for the women and for the weaks. Just Work Harder and become a Real Man like Elon Musk. 

I have a dream, that one day, those people will learn to listen and think for themselves.

For the record, it's not easy but it's simple. It mainly consists in learning to become comfortable to shut up for a while when someone tries to say something important.

I thought I was a feminist was I was young, but I was not, not really. I was shaped by my education, like everyone else. I didn't, I couldn't walk the talk. But I got much better at it.

It's all linked together. And today, when they describe me as an hysterical feminazi, I welcome their hatred.

## We Should Push Back Against Bad Practices

I went back to Job Hunting per se, because that's the core of what sucked for me. It took me an awful long time to understand that hiring is a two way process. We must not be passive obedient candidates who just submit a CV and hope for the best. I try to summarize my toughts in this unclear long article that was written mostly for me. 

{% embed https://dev.to/jmfayard/job-hunting-just-submit-your-cv-and-hope-for-the-best-o12 %}

I had started with salary negociations, I continues with other things that many developers hate but are not supposed to talk about openly.

Next on the list were taking home challenges

{% embed https://dev.to/jmfayard/keep-calm-and-just-say-no-to-coding-challenges-1a4 %}

I targeted more toxic superficially good ideas that plague developer careers. For example Robber Tech Barons want everyone to believe they should learn to code, because it suits their interests. But they don't tell you the full story. It is indeed **open to** everyone, but it is not **for** everyone. And the difference matters.

{% embed https://dev.to/jmfayard/everyone-should-learn-to-code-is-bullshit-2mgk %}

Here is a more positive story with my 5 years old nephew. 

{% embed https://dev.to/jmfayard/why-do-you-have-too-many-tabs-opened-an-almost-imaginary-conversation-with-my-5-years-old-nephew-4721 %}

## We Can And Must Improve Tech Hiring Somewhat

Behind the scenes, since 3 years I had met incredibly good tech recruiters. And oh, boy, did it change my mind. 

I used to genuinely despise recruiters. I thought the whole thing was a farce. 

Since then, I realized that while the perception I had at that time was entirely justified, the recruiters themselves were not the real issue here. Bad hiring practices were the real issues, always were. 

As strange as it may seem, I had to become a recruiter myself to close all my loops.

It took me a very long time to admit, but I can now make my outing : I am a recruiter too. 
And I would try hard to flip recruiting on its head.
Ideally I would like to like an agent for artists, but for developers. 
Start with their needs and defend their interests with companies.

{% embed https://dev.to/jmfayard/im-a-double-agent-developer-recruiter-3odd %}

## As it turns out, it's possible. 

It's not the whole story though, and I have don't have much english-speaking material for this year, because I was learning my new job in France and doing it in french. 

Things were difficult, but I had never been so motivated in my life.

Something I struggled with heavily, is that I thought I had to be on LinkedIn. I didn't like it but this is were you hire, right ?
But this didn't go well, LinkedIn was toxic as F# for me. I started to do clickbaits and scambaits, because that's work on LinkedIn. Best case scenario it was a joke like here.

{% embed https://dev.to/jmfayard/why-real-developers-should-rewrite-everything-in-rust-in-2024-2hh %}

But it was often way darker than that, and I had one last obstacle to overcome, get out of Microsoft LinkedIn real fast. 

{% embed https://dev.to/jmfayard/microsoft-linkedin-is-broken-and-why-microsoft-will-replace-it-with-something-better-19jp %}

I decided to go absolute full circle and to open source all my career-related content and put it on Microsoft GitHub. It is a very early stage chaotic mess that you can bookmark here for later. 

{% embed https://github.com/jmfayard/we-shall-improve-hiring-somehwat %}

## What's next ?

I don't know, predictions are hard when they are about the future.
But I'm at peace, at least, a very long last.
